Gen Z Luv - Central Cee
[Intro]
When our children ask us how did we meet, I'm tellin' them, "Gen Z love"
"FYP love, IG love"

[Verse 1]
My crisis ain't from cost of living
I think 'bout death like, "God forbid it"
American Express got no limit
Career consists of lots of women
How can I convince you I'm not the villain?
Shit's dramatic like opera singin'
Down on one knee, I got a proposition
In the past I was not consistent
Out of these girls, you're top division
Can't downgrade and lower my standard
When I first saw you on the 'Gram, bae, I was in awe and showin' the mandem
Askin' advice, "How can I slide in there?"
Usin' words not my usual language
I clocked that you just came out of a breakup
Been on your social media ranting
Slid up and replied to your story, you ain't responded, I wanna unsend it
Got me stalkin' your Facebook page and preeing your friends list
Saw that you followed a fellow acquaintance
You ain't even mine, yet I'm feelin' envious
Promiscuous chick make me wanna risk it, I like how you're real uncensored

[Chorus]
When our children ask us how did we meet
I'm tellin' them, "Gen Z love, FYP love, IG love"
Saw her on the Explore Page, like, I need to explore deeper
Suggested accounts said that we got mutuals
But you don't fuck with them, me neither
When I'm with you, I get baby fever
I met your mum on the FYP
We're young and our love's Gen Z
Mum said that it ain't gon' last
I'm tellin' her, "We gon' see"
They say our relationship is childish
You're my baby, so I agree
Started with an IG like
Now you're down to ride, just like a G

[Verse 2]
If it weren't for the algorithm, I wouldn't have found my woman
We're messin' around and act like kids, give me a nostalgic feelin'
Took you on all of them trips, now you got my accountant trippin'
Sent you a thousand roses, not like you're local, a thousand miles I've driven
You ain't even gave me the ick yet, I ain't even seen red flags yet
Get mad and you call me a dickhead, got me addicted, feel like a crackhead
Passenger seat just givin' me side-eye, it's giving main-character syndrome
You ain't gotta connect to the Wi-Fi, let's just talk and put down the iPhone
She liked my post, I liked her post
Love at first sight, love at first scroll
I ain't perfect, I'm tryna learn though
I hope it's worth it when we turn old
Still recoverin', I'm not okay
So I'm paranoid that she won't stay
I might catch a whine, this ain't Soul Train
I'm afraid this ain't like the old days

[Chorus]
When our children ask us how did we meet
I'm tellin' them, "Gen Z love, FYP love, IG love"
Saw her on the Explore Page, like, I need to explore deeper
Suggested accounts said that we got mutuals
But you don't fuck with them, me neither
When I'm with you, I get baby fever
I met your mum on the FYP
We're young and our love's Gen Z
Mum said that it ain't gon' last
I'm tellin' her, "We gon' see"
They say our relationship is childish
You're my baby, so I agree
Started with an IG like
Now you're down to ride, just like a G
